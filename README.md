# UFOs
Mod-10 JavaScript,  Bootstrap and UFO 

# Background 
For this module we were supposed to use a JavaScript array to build fully interactive tables, and filters to analyze UFO sightings . We are able to customize the web page by using Bootstrap, to allow them to be cleaner, while still being able to maintain them being interactive. The assignment is to further develop the dynamic tables, to add more depth to the UFO webpage. To allow the users to filter multiple criteria at the same time.

# Results:
Once the web page is open. One is met with a simple description of what the website is trying to tell. From the main title, down to the background.  See images below. Going further down.  The results are a clean table that is able to be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape. As well as a clear button to reset everything.

# Summary:
Overall the webpage is clean, simple, easy to read, and is user friendly. The only real drawback, that is really observable, is the lack of data. Sure it's clean in regards to what one can search. For example: date, and city. But it only gives one a short comment section on what was seen/observed. To add some more depth to the web page, as well as the data section. One could make the description interactive. As in add a clickable button, to go to more details within the description itself. Because it's already short, simple, and to the point. One can skim and sort easily. But if one wanted to know more, one couldn't click on the description. Or another way that the site could be improved, is add a table of contents of the most popular sightings with links to go directly to them.
